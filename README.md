# palindromeChecker
This repository contains a simple palindrome checker written in C++. The program takes a sequence of numbers or letters, removes spaces, and ignores non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation), then checks if the sequence is a palindrome, i.e., if it can be read the same way forward and backward.
